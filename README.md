### Known issues when running locally and how to fix
- Git automatically changes the End Of Line (EOL) Sequence of some files from `LF` to `CRLF`, causing problems with docker
    - Fix: after cloning the repo, manually change the EOL sequence of the following files to `LF` instead of `CRLF`:
        - `docker\backend\Dockerfile`
        - `docker\backend\wsgi-entrypoint.sh`
        - `docker\nginx\Dockerfile`
- Docker returns a `401 Unauthorized: failed to authorize` when building the images
    - Fix: run `docker login` in terminal
